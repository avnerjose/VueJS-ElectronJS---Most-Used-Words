# Most Used Words

This is a project from Cod3r's udemy course. 

This aplication was made using ElectronJS and VueJS, it is capable of reading
subtitles files (.srt) and showing the words that appear in the subtitle and
how many times that word appears. 
It sorts the words from the most frequent ones the the less frequent.
